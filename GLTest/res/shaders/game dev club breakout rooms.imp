game dev club breakout rooms
separate objects
sharp autosmooth creases (uvs)
circles and connecting on flat faces (looptools)

conform edge to shape

cast modifier

select by different things

knife e and c

proportional editing

baking
-high resolution
-average normals for sharp edge low poly
-make sure curvature matches as much as possible

bevel

shrinkwrap modifier

array modifier

solidify

bevel modifier

shrink wrap is key to curved hard surface details

alt s for shrink fatten

alt e for extrude along normals	

SET FLOW 

set flow is falster than shrinkwrap but doesnt always work

only ngons on flat surfaces

use support loops when possible

sekect flat faces

scale (x/y/z) to flatten faces or verts or edges

select sharp edges 
-also good for uvs

creases only when u want completely sharp edges because doesnt add curvature
bevel for curvature (relatively large)

select sharp edges + bevel for getting smooth edges (sometimes supporting loops to sttop wierd shading]
bridge edge loops

recalculate normals for good bevelling (remember bevel always works even on ngons)

break based on concave

TRIS rather than large ngons on surface (connect as manyu things as possible)
miter outer arc

cover rope physics and ui
and then give assignments
