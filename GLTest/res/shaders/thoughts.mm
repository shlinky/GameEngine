language is the process of representing human thoughts; a storage medium for thoughts outside of the brain; the art of most accurately representing brain process (electrical processes)
converting from one mind to another through stimuli (if people are states can they be continually changed from one to another (is the new person still the old one because of continuuity))
can a human mind be run through just a person manually calculating stuff (talking to the dead by evaluating equations)
are all possible beings alive? because all possible beings (mathematical processes) do exist mathematically, so it must exist?

chords are just abstractions of harmony  (can often not capture the full truth and detail of harmony involved) (more extentions is not color but just further clarifying detail) improv is notes that are part of the harmony (fit with the rest of harmony to create texture) (dont only think of as scales) certains souns are created withih n improve because certain notes play in differently wiht the rest of the harmony






soul exists as a limit to infinity of the quality of information we can numerically distill about what makes an evolving process it, isolating a constant tensor independant of time that represents that mind. This quantity can probably be very useful. Its quality (loss function) might be dependant on its predictive value. Just how language is a kind of distilled quantity from thoughts. It exists because it can but we can quantify to know it.
is there truly no information? because given nothing, one can deduce all truth?

Language as a stimuli to create thoughts in a mind, but fails to capture the full detail of a thought (or mathematical process). Perfect language would capture full detail of these processes (essentially would be the exact stimuli required to evoke an exact mental process in another's mind). Sometimes words dont retain the same meaning to me as when i first read or wrote them (so it would have to be changed based on current mental state (an algorithm to create stimuli to recreate a thought process in you based on ur current mental state (this would be perfect language)))

' The whole circuit can have a resistance because it is simply a quantity describing the ratio between voltage and current in that path.
